  <p>Hello, my name is Preston Corley, I am currently a senior at Palm Desert High School and participating in a computer science class to learn various programming languages.
   I enjoy working with computers and am interested in learning code, now I am familiar with block coding and working with Andriod apps. One of my goals after high school is to extend my education and attend
   either a 4-year college or transferring to a university from community college. I am not completely sure with what I want to pursue as a career but I am highly considering a STEM related field. My hobbys consists
   of online gaming, digital trading, and reading. </p>
